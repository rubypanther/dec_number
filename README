DecNumber is a wrapper around ICU-decNumber (Copyright (c) IBM Corporation)
that subclasses Numeric.

The main benefit over BigDecimal and other things is that each instance carries it's own context around with it in a DecContext object. The context is what dertimines the precision and rounding behavior.

An example of this in use might be a gas station where there are pump prices with 10ths of cents and store prices with only cents. The register sets a precision of 2 rounding up, and it can use the prices reported from the pump without incident.

Another example is a database with Decimal columns with differing precision and where you can't accept using Floats.

Another use case would be bitcoin, where you need an arbitrary precision, mixed with dollars.

I don't expect to instantiate these object directly, instead I will bind them to SQL Decimal in an ORM, or using some sort of Money class.
