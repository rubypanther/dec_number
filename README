WARNING! Pre-release, not finished.

DecNumber is a wrapper around ICU-decNumber (Copyright (c) IBM Corporation)
that subclasses Numeric.

The main benefit over BigDecimal and other things is that each instance carries it's own context around with it in a DecContext object. The context is what dertimines the precision and rounding behavior.

An example of this in use might be a gas station where there are pump prices with 10ths of cents and store prices with only cents. The register sets a precision of 2 rounding up, and it can use the prices reported from the pump without incident.

Another example is a database with Decimal columns with differing precision and where you can't accept using Floats.

Another use case would be bitcoin, where you need an arbitrary precision, mixed with dollars.

I don't expect to instantiate these object directly, instead I will bind them to SQL Decimal in an ORM, or using some sort of Money class.

If you'd like to help out, please write tests!

Currently they are not very good citizens of the Numeric family and try to give you back DecNumber objects whenever used. This is intentional. It might be a better idea in a Money class than returned from a db, however.

TODO: Most of the methods should accept a context as an argument. Currently the context is attached to the receiver.
